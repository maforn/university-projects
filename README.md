### [Information Security Lab - Information Security Lab, Sep - Dec 2025](https://github.com/maforn/information-security-lab-2025)
> [!WARNING]  
> At the moment, I'm not allowed to make this public.

A semester-long lab course consisting of four independent modules, each focused on a different area of information security. Every module included a graded practical project:
- Formal Protocol Verification — Modeling security protocols in Tamarin and verifying their properties using formal methods.  
- Binary Exploitation — Vulnerability discovery, and attacks with PIE, canaries, ASLR and ret2libc.  
- Machine Learning Security — Attacks on ML models: adversarial techniques with defenses and preprocessing; inference of training data on shadow models without ground truths.  
- Trusted Execution Environments — .

### [SCION Go Project - Network Security, Oct 2025](https://github.com/maforn/scion-go-netsec-project)
> [!WARNING]  
> At the moment, I'm not allowed to make this public.

A Go-based project for the Network Security course, focusing on the SCION next-generation internet architecture. The main tasks involved implementing a SCION client, completing packet-handling challenges, and developing logic for multi-path selection and evaluation.

# Computer Science Projects @ University of Bologna
This is a list of the projects I have worked on so far as part of the Computer Science Bachelor at the University of Bologna.

### [Machine Learning Competitive Projects - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Gen - Feb 2025](https://github.com/maforn/competitiveProjectsML)
Machine Learning projects for the competitive AI course. Both are on mixed images separation, one is about classification, the other is instead about reconstruction.

### [MEMEAirlines - Databases - Gen 2025](https://github.com/maforn/MEMEAirlines)
A structured database analysis and design project covering requirement analysis, conceptual and logical design, normalization, and SQL implementation. It includes ER modeling, data dictionary, business rules, and testing to ensure a well-structured MySQL database integrated with Vue.js and Node.js.

### [Backgammon Social Site - Software Engineering, Oct - Dec 2024](https://github.com/maforn/BackgammonSocialSiteSWE)
This project serves as a practical exercise in applying SCRUM and AGILE methodologies by developing a web application for online backgammon. It supports gameplay between two players or a player versus an intelligent agent (bot).  Built with Vue.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Python (FastAPI), WebAssembly. It makes great use of CI/CD and DevOps with Docker and SonarQube.

### [Selfie - Web Technologies, Jun - Sep 2024](https://github.com/mattiaferrarini/Selfie)
A website to help students manage their private, social, and academic life. Built with Vue.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Node.js.

### [µPandOS - Operating Systems, Oct 2023 - Jun 2024](https://github.com/maforn/microPandOS)
C implementation of a microkernel operating system on the µRISCV architecture.

### [Notebooks - Numerical Computing, Oct 2023 - Jan 2024](https://github.com/maforn/Numerical-Computing)
Notebooks covering topics such as SVD, nonlinear equations, LSQ, polynomial regression, unconstrained optimization and image enhancement.

### [CXGame - Algorithms and Data Structures, Jun - Jul 2023](https://github.com/maforn/CXGame) 
AI agent capable of playing CXGame, a generalized version of the Connect Four game where the grid size and the number of pieces to align can be customized. 

### [SuperAlfaBros - Programming, Nov 2022 - Feb 2023](https://github.com/maforn/SuperAlfaBros)
A platformer game in ASCII graphic developed with C++ and ncurses library.
The project includes several levels, enemies, power-ups and a market.

### [Nand2Tetris - Computer Architecture, Nov - Dec 2022](https://github.com/mattiaferrarini/Nand2Tetris)
First six projects of _From Nand to Tetris: Building a Modern Computer From First Principles_.

# General Projects @ Collegio Superiore
### [SLAM 3D Local Simulation - Sustainable Air Mobility - Sep 2025](https://github.com/maforn/slam-3d-local-simulation)
A Python-based 3D simulator for a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) loop-closure algorithm. The simulation incorporates drift and sensor noise, performs local optimization, and visualizes the resulting errors and views.

### [WhatsApp Network Analysis - Network Theory and Artificial Intelligence - Apr 2025](https://github.com/maforn/whatsapp-network-analysis)
A project to analyze a WhatsApp Chat as Network based on the messages. We parsed a text-exported chat log, buildt a directed “message-response” graph, applied community detection (Louvain method), computed centrality metrics, and visualized both the network structure and community statistics.

### [Digital Simulations of the Antikythera Mechanism - Archimedes: Greek Mathematics and History of European Science - Sep 2024](https://github.com/maforn/digital-antikythera-mechanism)
 _Part of the presentation for a speech at Cost Action CaLISTA General Meeting 2025_
This project provides two interactive Python-based simulations of the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Hellenistic calculatin machine. The simulations (ancient and modern) model the front and back dials, including the Zodiac, Metonic, and Saros cycles.

### [Grasshopper Simulator - Collective and Distributed Intelligence, Jul 2023](https://github.com/maforn/grasshopperSimulator)
Grasshopper Simulator is a Python simulation made with pygame that emulates how grasshoppers with and without the ability to react to aggregation pheromones would live in a simulated environment
